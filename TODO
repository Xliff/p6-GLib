- Remember to add GOption -- https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Commandline-option-parser.html
- use 'git log --name-only -n' to extract version and associated stats file to generate compile times SVG

- Implement "is protected" trait. Yes, this has been done before but a better implementation would involve
  the use of .^mro. Basically, allow the method to run if:
    <Actual class object> ~~ self.^mro.any

 note that you CANNOT use self, as that would be a tautology. You must use the class object of 
 class implementing the protected method! This means that "is protected" trait must capture this in some
 way, shape or form.
